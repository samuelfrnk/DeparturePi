1)fresh install of RPI OS bookworm (Expand file system -> reboot -> and then run sudo rpi-update)

2)sudo raspi-config

Advanced -> change wayland to X11

Interface-> SPI - enable

3) in the terminal type

sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt

Add a "#" in front of the line "dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d"

add this line at the end of the file " dtoverlay=piscreen,speed=18000000,drm "

(remove the double inverted commas "")

4) Reboot

5) sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-evdev

6) sudo mv /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-evdev.conf /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/45-evdev.conf

7) sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/45-evdev.conf

Add these lines at the end of the file

"Section "InputClass"

Identifier "evdev touchscreen catchall"

MatchIsTouchscreen "on"

MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"

Driver "evdev"

Option "InvertX" "false"

Option "InvertY" "true"

EndSection"

(remove the double inverted commas "")

NOTE: if the touch input is still not working correctly , then play around with Option "InvertX" "false", Option "InvertY" "true" in the step 7 untill you get the desired result.

8) sudo reboot

9)sudo touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-calibration.conf

10)sudo apt-get install xinput-calibrator

11) sudo reboot

12) type this in the terminal : "DISPLAY=:0.0 xinput_calibrator"

(remove the double inverted commas "")

Calibration software will run and will be visible on the screen, press the 4 markers to calibrate and the touch would become pretty accurate.

This guide should also work if the LCD is just a plain blank white when you first connect the lcd to the rpi5.
